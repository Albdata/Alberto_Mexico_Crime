# Alberto_Mexico_Crime
Exploratory analysis to assess the evolution of crime in Mexico (2015-2022) 

When everybody thinks of Mexico, tacos, mariachi bands, or marvelous spots such as Cancún come to our minds. Undoubtedly, is one of the most important Latin American countries and the closest point to the giant United States.
Unfortunately, Mexico suffers from a disease, a permanent curse that stains its image; we are talking about crime, the same crime which floods the streets with blood and tears. 
Below, we will take a look at the behavior of crime throughout Mexico; let's try to find out how it develops in every state and how's been opening out over the years.
To explore it, we'll use a Dataset from the Mexican government.
The research was done with Python and its libraries( Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) in a Jupyter Notebook. After cleaning and exploring the dataset we proceeded to develop a Machine Learning algorithm ( Cluster focused on Ciudad de México) and a LDA model(supervised learning).
